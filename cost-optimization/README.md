> **Save 50-90% on Claude API costs** with real production data & techniques

## 🔥 Key Discoveries (What Official Docs Don't Tell You)

| Discovery | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Bigger batches = Faster** | 294 requests finished before 10 requests! |
| **22x efficiency gap** | Large batch: 0.45 min/req vs Small: 9.84 min/req |
| **Not FIFO** | Anthropic prioritizes bigger batches |
| **Image cache = only 14%** | Not 90%! (Images can't be cached, only text prompts) |

### TL;DR

```
Want to save money? → Batch 100+ requests together
Want to save time?  → Also batch 100+ (they finish first!)
Working with images? → Batch API is enough (cache doesn't help much)
Working with text?   → Use both Batch + Cache (up to 95% savings)
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install the skill
cp claude-api-cost-optimization.skill.md ~/.claude/skills/

# Calculate your potential savings
python scripts/calculate_savings.py --input 10000 --output 5000 --requests 100
```

## 💰 Three Techniques, Massive Savings

| Technique | Savings | Best For | Docs |
|-----------|---------|----------|------|
| **Batch API** | 50% off | Non-urgent bulk tasks | [Reference](references/batch-api.md) |
| **Prompt Caching** | 90% off | Repeated system prompts | [Reference](references/prompt-caching.md) |
| **Extended Thinking** | ~80% off | Complex reasoning | [Reference](references/extended-thinking.md) |

## 📊 Proof: Real Billing Data

### 🎬 Latest: Jelly 294-Video GAIA Tagging (2026-02-02)

> **From**: [Washin Village](https://washinmura.jp) - Animal sanctuary in Boso Peninsula, Japan

**Mission**: AI behavior tagging for 294 daily videos of 28 rescue cats & dogs

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Batches | 2 × 283 requests = **100% success** |
| Cost | **$5.32** vs Standard API: **$714.86** |
| Savings | **99.3%** ($709.54 saved) |
| Time | Completed within 24 hours (fully automated) |

**Key Strategy**:
```python
Batch API (50% discount)
  + Prompt Caching (90% discount)
  + Structured JSON output
  = From $714.86 → $5.32
```

**Technical Highlights**:
1. ✅ Unified 3,500-token system prompt (annotation guidelines)
2. ✅ Near 100% cache hit rate (283× reuse)
3. ✅ Split batching strategy (avoid single large batch)
4. ✅ JSON structured output (reduce output tokens)

**Cost Breakdown**:
- Input: $0.51 + Cache: $0.39 = $0.90 (16.9%)
- Output: $4.42 (83.1%)

**Key Finding**: Even with extreme input optimization via caching, **output tokens still dominate costs**. Next optimization: reduce AI response length with structured JSON.

### 🔥 Previous: 294 Video Batch Job (2026-01-28)

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Files Processed | 294 |
| Total Tokens | 1,500,944 |
| Original Cost | $11.04 |
| **Batch Cost** | **$5.52** |
| **💰 Savings** | **$5.52 (50%)** |
| Per Request | $0.0188 |

#### Token Breakdown (From Anthropic Console)
| Token Type | Count | Cost |
|------------|-------|------|
| Input (no cache) | 365,624 | $0.55 |
| Cache write (1h) | 106,920 | $0.32 |
| Cache read | 416,988 | $0.06 |
| Output | 611,412 | $4.59 |

### 🔥 Surprising Discovery: Bigger = Faster AND Cheaper!

| Batch | Requests | Sent | Done | Per Request |
|-------|----------|------|------|-------------|
| 🐘 Large | 294 | 10:22 | 12:35 | **0.45 min** |
| 🐰 Small | 10 | 11:50 | 13:28 | 9.84 min |
| 🐁 Test | 3 | 01:20 | 02:23 | 20.77 min |

**Key findings:**
- ✅ Large batch finished **53 minutes before** small batch (even though sent 1.5h earlier)
- ✅ Large batch is **22x more efficient** per request!
- ✅ Anthropic does NOT process in order (FIFO) — bigger batches get priority

### 💡 Why? (Simple Explanation)

```
Think of GPU like an oven:
🔥 Preheat = 15 min (fixed cost)

Large (294): Preheat → Bake all 294 → 0.45 min each ✅
Small (10):  Preheat → Bake only 10 → 9.84 min each ❌

The more you bake, the cheaper per item!
```

| + Batch | $0.019 | $5.57 | 50% |
| **+ Both** | **$0.016** | **$4.79** | **57%** 🔥 |

## 🔧 Code Examples

### Prompt Caching (90% off repeated prompts)

```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    system=[{
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Your long system prompt (>1024 tokens)...",
        "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}  # ← This saves 90%!
    }],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

### Batch API (50% off everything)

```python
batch = client.messages.batches.create(
    requests=[
        {
            "custom_id": "task-001",
            "params": {
                "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
                "max_tokens": 1024,
                "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Translate..."}]
            }
        }
        # Add up to 100,000 requests!
    ]
)
```

## 💡 Key Insight: Image Workloads

> **Why only 14% caching savings instead of 90%?**

In image tasks, images = ~85% of tokens. Only the system prompt (~15%) is cacheable.

```
Input Composition:
├── System Prompt: ~15% → ✅ Cacheable (90% off)
└── Image Data:    ~85% → ❌ Cannot cache

Actual Savings: 15% × 90% = ~14%
```

**This is NOT in the official docs — we learned it the hard way!**
